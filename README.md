# Employment Data Analysis Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Employment Data Analysis Project! In this project, my partner and I dive into the world of employment data using the [Employment in the U.S.](https://datahub.io/core/employment-us) dataset. This dataset provides valuable information on employment, unemployment, and related statistics in the United States.

Our main objectives in this project are to:

- Explore historical employment data trends.
- Develop predictive models to forecast future employment figures.
- Create engaging visualizations to help understand the data better.
- Provide insights and potential use cases for employment data analysis.

## Data Source

We've sourced our data from [datahub.io](https://datahub.io/core/employment-us). This dataset is a treasure trove of information related to employment, unemployment, population, labor force, and more.

## Data Description

The dataset includes the following columns:

1. `year`: The year for which the data is recorded.
2. `population`: The total population.
3. `labor_force`: The number of people in the labor force.
4. `population_percent`: The percentage of the population.
5. `employed_total`: The total number of employed individuals.
6. `employed_percent`: The percentage of employed individuals.
7. `agriculture_ratio`: The ratio of individuals employed in agriculture.
8. `nonagriculture_ratio`: The ratio of individuals employed in non-agriculture.
9. `unemployed`: The number of unemployed individuals.
10. `unemployed_percent`: The percentage of unemployed individuals.
11. `not_in_labor`: The number of individuals not in the labor force.
