# US Employment Data Analysis

Welcome to the US Employment Data Analysis project! This project delves into the realm of employment data using the [Employment in the U.S.](https://datahub.io/core/employment-us) dataset. Our goal is to explore historical employment trends, create predictive models, craft compelling visualizations, and offer insights into the world of employment statistics.

**Note:** This project has been created for the [Youth Data Hackathon on DevPost](https://youth-data-hack.devpost.com/), a platform for innovative data solutions.

## Data Source

Our dataset originates from [datahub.io](https://datahub.io/core/employment-us), serving as a valuable source of information on employment, unemployment, population, labor force, and more.

## Data Description

The dataset contains several columns, each providing essential employment-related information:

- `year`: The recorded year.
- `population`: The total population.
- `labor_force`: The labor force size.
- `population_percent`: The percentage of the population.
- `employed_total`: The count of employed individuals.
- `employed_percent`: The percentage of the employed population.
- `agriculture_ratio`: The ratio of individuals employed in agriculture.
- `nonagriculture_ratio`: The ratio of individuals employed in non-agriculture sectors.
- `unemployed`: The number of unemployed individuals.
- `unemployed_percent`: The percentage of the unemployed population.
- `not_in_labor`: The count of individuals not in the labor force.
- `footnotes`: Additional explanatory notes.

## Highlights of Our Analysis

### Employment Trends
- Examining historical employment trends reveals a steady increase in total employment in the US, closely aligned with population growth.
- Despite this general trend, we observed instances where the growth in employment did not match the population increase, with noticeable declines in employment around the year 2010.

### Force Labor Composition
- Our analysis highlights the shift in labor force composition over time. The percentage of individuals employed in agriculture has significantly decreased, while non-agricultural employment has risen.

### Predictive Models
- We developed predictive models for employed and unemployed populations. Our models offer forecasts and confidence intervals, allowing us to identify periods beyond these bounds, which indicate recession periods.

### Pre and Post-Recession Analysis
- We analyzed employment and unemployment patterns during recession periods in the US, focusing on the 1981-1982 and 2008-2009 economic downturns. We observed significant changes in these periods, emphasizing the importance of understanding economic cycles.

### Power BI Visualization
- We will be using Power BI to create interactive and insightful visualizations to enhance our understanding of the employment data.
